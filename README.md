# About Dataset
Introduction

Infectious diseases are illnesses caused by pathogenic microorganisms, such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites, that can spread from one person to another through various modes of transmission, including direct contact, droplets, airborne particles, and contaminated food or water. The impact of infectious diseases on public health and the global economy is significant, and their incidence and prevalence vary across regions, populations, and time.

The dataset includes information about the location, type, and duration of the outbreaks, as well as demographic information about the affected individuals, such as age, gender, and race. It also includes information about the suspected or confirmed pathogen responsible for the outbreak, the mode of transmission, and the source of the outbreak.

The data are organized by year and by state and include outbreaks of a wide range of infectious diseases, including foodborne illnesses, respiratory infections, and sexually transmitted infections.

This dataset can be used to analyze patterns of infectious disease outbreaks over time and across geographic regions in the United States and to identify risk factors associated with different types of outbreaks. It may be of interest to public health officials, epidemiologists, and researchers studying infectious diseases.
